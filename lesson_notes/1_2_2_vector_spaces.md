## Properties of a vector space
![](../docs/properties_of_a_vector_space.png)

### Scalar multiplication
![](../docs/scalar_multiplication.png)

- Notice the representation in the graph

#### Scalar multiplication in L2[-1, 1]

### Addition
![](../docs/addition.png)

- Notice the transpose $T$ notation, which is required as vectors have to be in column shape

## Inner product aka dot product
![](../docs/inner_product.png)

- Notice the inner product notation of $a$ and $b$ $\langle a, b \rangle$

### `Self-inner product`
![](../docs/the_norm.png)

- Notice the self-inner product of $x$ being resulted from the sides of the orthogonal triangle (Pythagoras theorem), geometrically speaking

- Notice `the norm` notation $||x||$ of the vector **$x$**
